  hline = NULL, area = NULL, year, IE = NULL, IEnames = NULL,
  legnames = NULL, threshold = NULL, data = FALSE, ratio = FALSE,

\method{diamondplot}{ccamforecast}(x, ...)

\method{diamondplot}{forecastset}(x, what, ylab = what,
  xlab = "Management Procedure", hline = NULL, area = NULL,
  year = "all", IE = NULL, IEnames = NULL, legnames = NULL,
  threshold = NULL, data = FALSE, ratio = FALSE, OMtype = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object(s) returned from ccam.forecast}

\item{what}{statistic returned from ccam.forecast}

\item{ylab}{y label}

\item{xlab}{x label}

\item{hline}{plot horizontal line(s)}

\item{area}{color plot underneath this yintercept}

\item{year}{year for which the statistics needs to be plotted
\itemize{
  \item{NULL}{ Takes median all years}
  \item{'numeric vector'}{ Takes median of specified years}
  \item{'threshold'}{ Takes year at which threshold is reached (see threshold param)}
  \item{'percyear'}{ Takes percentage of years where threshold is reached (see threshold param)}
  \item{'zone'}{ Makes a facet grid in which the statistic is grouped by zone (critical, healthy or cautious)}
}}

\item{IE}{Which IE to plot (if vector)? Defaults to collapsed IE. Can be numeric or string (grep).}

\item{IEnames}{character string containing alternative names for the IEs}

\item{legnames}{character string containing alternative names for the legend (OM types)}

\item{threshold}{if year=TRUE than a threshold can be specified and the year at which it is reached becomes the y value for 'what'}

\item{data}{logical. return data instead of plot.}

\item{ratio}{logical. devide by LRP?}

\item{OMtype}{logical. OMbase/core/whatever present?}
}
\description{
Diamond plots of MSE output
}
\details{
performance (what) by management procedure, IE and OM type. OM type is defined by the OM name (numbers and 'OM' are removed).
